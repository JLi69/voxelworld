# This file contains a list of drops are blocks
# Syntax:
#	"block_id" {
# 	   "held_item" = "item/weight|item/weight|..."
# 	   ...
# 	}
# For example, if you wanted to change grass to drop dirt when broken, do
# the following:
#	# You can also just simply put the block id of `1`, which is grass
#	# Some blocks have an item alias that will be translated to the appropriate block
#	"grass" {
#		"empty" = "dirt/1.0";
# 	}
# If a held item does not do anything special for collecting a block, the drops
# will be defaulted to if the player was just holding nothing
# Another example for having random drops:
#	"leaves" {
#		"empty" = "sapling/1.0|empty/9.0";
#	}
# The weights do not need to add to 1.0, in this case, leaves should drop
# saplings about 1/10 of the time.
